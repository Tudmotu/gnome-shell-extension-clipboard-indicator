Installation
----------------

Installation via git is performed by cloning the repo into your local gnome-shell extensions directory (usually ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/)::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Tudmotu/gnome-shell-extension-clipboard-indicator.git <extensions-dir>/clipboard-indicator@tudmotu.com

After cloning the repo, the extension is practically installed yet disabled. In
order to enable it, you need to use gnome-tweak-tool - find the extension,
titled 'Clipboard Indicator', in the 'Extensions' screen and turn it 'On'.
You may need to restart the shell (Alt+F2 and insert 'r' in the prompt) for the
extension to be listed there.

Alternatively, you can use `gnome-extensions` CLI to enable the extension::

    $ gnome-extensions list | grep -i 'clipboard-indicator' | xargs gnome-extensions enable
